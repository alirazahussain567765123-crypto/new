      <p><strong>Saher is a technology company</strong> specializing in three-phase water-cut and multiphase flow metering solutions. Our innovative technology is being validated by a growing number of energy companies worldwide, underscoring its reliability and effectiveness.</p>
      
      <h2>Historic GCC Milestone</h2>
      <p>Notably, we are the <strong>first company in the GCC</strong> to have developed multiphase metering technology entirely within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This distinction has made Saudi Aramco a particularly valued partner for Saher.</p>
      
      <p>Recently, we achieved a <strong>historic milestone</strong>: obtaining pre-qualification approval from Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil and gas company.</p>
      
      <h2>Rigorous Testing at DNV</h2>
      <p>This approval followed <strong>rigorous blind flow loop trials</strong> conducted at DNV's state-of-the-art, third-party test facility in the Netherlands.</p>
      
      <h3>Testing Protocol</h3>
      <p>During these trials, conducted in collaboration with Saudi Aramco and DNV, Saher's multiphase meter was tested with various combinations of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil flow rates</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Water flow rates</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Gas flow rates</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
      <p>Adhering to Saudi Aramco's stringent engineering procedure, the meter's performance was compared to highly accurate reference measurements from DNV's flow loop.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Test Conditions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluids</strong>: Natural gas, synthetic oil (D-120), and brine</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure</strong>: 500 psi controlled environment</li>
        <li><strong>Duration</strong>: Five days of comprehensive testing</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Detailed data analytics considering reference equipment measurement uncertainties</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Outstanding Results</h2>
      <p>The results demonstrated that <strong>Saher's multiphase meter performed within specifications</strong> in both:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>âœ… <strong>Oil-continuous flow regions</strong></li>
        <li>âœ… <strong>Water-continuous flow regions</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This validation confirms our technology's reliability across the full spectrum of multiphase flow conditions encountered in real-world operations.</p>

      <p><strong>We are thrilled to announce</strong> that Saher Flow Solutions has successfully completed a field trial in collaboration with one of the major National Oil Companies (NOCs) in the GCC region.</p>
      
      <h2>Exceeding Expectations</h2>
      <p>Our innovative <strong>compact, skid-mounted, non-radioactive Multiphase Flow Meter (MPFM)</strong> exceeded expectations, meeting and surpassing the accuracy targets for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>âœ… <strong>Water-cut measurements</strong></li>
        <li>âœ… <strong>Liquid flow rate measurements</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Rigorous Field Testing</h2>
      <p>This milestone trial was conducted in <strong>direct comparison with a portable test (liquid-gas) separator</strong>, where our MPFM delivered consistently reliable and accurate results.</p>
      
      <p>This achievement reinforces the capability of our technology to perform under demanding field conditions, offering a cutting-edge solution for multiphase flow measurement <strong>without the need for radioactive sources</strong>.</p>
